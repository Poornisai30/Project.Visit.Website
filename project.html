       <h3>Causes and Symptoms of Infections</h3> 
    </header>
<p>Intestinal infections can significantly impact daily life, leading to discomfort and potential complications if not addressed promptly. Recognizing the early symptoms is crucial for timely intervention and effective treatment. In this article, we will explore the various symptoms associated with intestinal infections and how to identify them.Intestinal infections, also known as gastroenteritis or stomach flu, are illnesses that cause inflammation of the digestive tract, primarily the stomach and intestines. These infections are usually caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites and can lead to symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. </p>

    Bowel infections are caused by germs in the gut and are sometimes called gastrointestinal infections or gastroenteritis.
You can get a bowel infection by consuming contaminated water or food or by having contact with another person who has the infection.
Bowel infections can be caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites.
Severe symptoms include ongoing diarrhoea, fever, blood or mucus in your poo and dehydration.
Bowel infections can be prevented by following good hygiene practices and vaccinating your baby against rotavirus.
